		 *   Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
		 *   graphical applications to produce procedural
		 *   textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.
		 *   The main difference to the random() function is
		 *   that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
		 *   n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates
		 *   corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed
		 *   only for the lifespan of the program; see the
		 *   noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D
		 *   and 3D noise, depending on the number of
		 *   coordinates given. The resulting value will always
		 *   be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be
		 *   animated by moving through the noise space as
		 *   demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd
		 *   dimension can also be interpreted as time.
		 *
		 *   The actual noise is structured similar to an audio
		 *   signal, in respect to the function's use of
		 *   frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics
		 *   in physics, perlin noise is computed over several
		 *   octaves which are added together for the final
		 *   result.
		 *
		 *   Another way to adjust the character of the
		 *   resulting sequence is the scale of the input
		 *   coordinates. As the function works within an
		 *   infinite space the value of the coordinates
		 *   doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
		 *   successive coordinates does (eg. when using
		 *   noise() within a loop). As a general rule the
		 *   smaller the difference between coordinates, the
		 *   smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.

		 *   above to customize the size and position of the

	 *   i)); pixels[index] = r; pixels[index+1] = g;
	 *   pixels[index+2] = b; pixels[index+3] = a; } }

	 *   enough to work with any pixelDensity. Note that
	 *   set() will automatically take care of setting all
	 *   the appropriate values in pixels[] for a given (x,
	 *   y) at any pixelDensity, but the performance may
	 *   not be as fast when lots of modifications are made

	 *   Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
	 *   graphical applications to produce procedural
	 *   textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.
	 *   The main difference to the random() function is
	 *   that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
	 *   n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates
	 *   corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed
	 *   only for the lifespan of the program; see the
	 *   noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D
	 *   and 3D noise, depending on the number of
	 *   coordinates given. The resulting value will always
	 *   be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be
	 *   animated by moving through the noise space as
	 *   demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd
	 *   dimension can also be interpreted as time.
	 *
	 *   The actual noise is structured similar to an audio
	 *   signal, in respect to the function's use of
	 *   frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics
	 *   in physics, perlin noise is computed over several
	 *   octaves which are added together for the final
	 *   result.
	 *
	 *   Another way to adjust the character of the
	 *   resulting sequence is the scale of the input
	 *   coordinates. As the function works within an
	 *   infinite space the value of the coordinates
	 *   doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
	 *   successive coordinates does (eg. when using
	 *   noise() within a loop). As a general rule the
	 *   smaller the difference between coordinates, the
	 *   smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.

	 *   applications, but this will differ depending on
	 *   use.
